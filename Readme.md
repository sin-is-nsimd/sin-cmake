# sin-cmake

`sin-cmake` contains CMake helpers for C++ projects.

CMake has bad reputation but it is widely use for C and C++ projects. We want to believe it is
possible to have simple CMake for our projects or projects with the same folders structures.

# Development

Project uses [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) as Python 3 code
formatter.

Project uses [conventional-pre-commit](https://github.com/compilerla/conventional-pre-commit)
to try to force good commit messages.
The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is already in the root folder of `sin-cmake`.
Run this command in the `sin-cmake` directory:
```sh
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```
